# Concentric Circle Spinner

This project was done as a [coding challenge #39](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-39) by Zero To Mastery.

The idea of this challenge was to create unique concentric circle spinner. During this challenge I have learned how animations and cubic-bezier work and managed to create my own concentric circle spinners.
